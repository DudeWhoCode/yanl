				<p><strong>Why yet another newsletter?</strong></p>

<p>Why not? I want to share my learnings and experiments with others. Usually, I will tweet them or sometimes blog about them but I want to deliver it to you
cutting the signal to noise ratio out there.
<br><br />
<br><br />
<strong>When can I expect an issue in my inbox?</strong></p>

<p>I am expecting to send it once in two weeks on Fridays.
<br><br />
<br>
<strong>How is it going to be structured?</strong></p>

<p>First few issues will be loosely structured just for me to experiment with the format.<br />
I want to keep this newsletter concise and to the point. I will talk about software as well as other interesting things apart from software
that will help you to be a better developer. Since I am not going to talk about any specific topic, I will include highlights in the
beginning, so that the reader will get the idea of an issue right away.

<strong>How did I find this name YANL?</strong></p>

<p>While I have a decent record of choosing cool names, I have to
entirely give it to <a href="https://twitter.com/dharm1t/status/1168563186347298816?s=20">@dharm1t</a> for suggesting this.</p>
