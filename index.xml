      <description>Why yet another newsletter?
Why not? How is it going to be structured?
First few issues will be loosely structured just for me to experiment with the format.
I want to keep this newsletter byte sized. I will talk about sofware as well as other things apart from software that will make one a better developer. Since I am not going to talk about any specific topics, I will include some tags or highlights in beginning of each newsletter so that reader will get an idea and it saves their time.</description>

      <description>Hi I am Naren. You probably should&amp;rsquo;ve seen me somewhere on internet as @DudeWhoCode, or probably not.
Either way this is an opininated newsletter on my journey in software engineering, learnings, personal growth, experiments, articles and of course funny thoughts on bi-weekly basis.
